# Agi-wallet
The main agenda for this project is to explore the technologies that i have learned through my curriculum and my personal interests. 
AGI wallet takes student htno as primary key and using a pin the transactions can be made to other students,canteen,stationery, library.
since the project is not deployed in a cloud and not connected to a gateway, Localhost is used for the simulation of the transaction process.
The .sql dump file can be imported to the XAMPP and the simulation of the transaction can be done.
